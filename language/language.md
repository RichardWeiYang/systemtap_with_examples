systemtap is so powerful, because we could write scripts to program the
behavior according to our purpose.

> The magic all exists in the script.

The script is like c/awk. The general idea is simple, while there are still
different concepts need to understand before we can handle the script.

Based on my humble understanding, a programming language could be divided into
several parts:

* Syntax
* Variables
* Control flow
* Function & Macro

Besides these, systemtap has several special parts:

* TypeCast
* Guru Mode
* Probe Point
* Predefined Functions

When I almost finish this serials, I found a very good [Language Reference][1]
from RH. I believe this one is more sophisticated than my serials. I would
recommend you to read that and my serials would refer to that one in some
points.

BTW, I am glad to see the author was my colleague. Thanks to IBM.
