systemtap provides many helpful predefined functions, like

* printf()
* print_backtrace()
* pp()
* execname()
* task_cpu()
* pid(), etc.

They are defined in /usr/share/systemtap/tapset. This is not only a "lib", but
also a very good learning material. 

[Predefinded Functions][1] is a good reference for those functions.
