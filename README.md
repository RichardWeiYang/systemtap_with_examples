# Systemtap

Recently I found systemtap is a fantastic tool for exploring the kernel and
userspace applications. While at the very beginning, it seems a little bit
hard for me to understand and start to use this tool.

After some struggling, I managed to run some tests and notice this tool is
really interesting and useful.

To help me memorize those steps and may help others new comers, this
serials is created.

Welcome your comments and suggestions.
