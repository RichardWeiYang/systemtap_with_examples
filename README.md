# Systemtap

Recently I found systemtap is an fantastic tool for exploring the kernel and userspace applications. While at the very beginning, it seems a little bit hard for me to understand and start hands on practice.

After some struggle, I managed to run some tests and appreciate the beautiful tool.

To help me memorize those steps and help others at the same time, this serials is created.

Welcome your comments and suggestions.
