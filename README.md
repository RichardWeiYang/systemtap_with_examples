# Systemtap

Recently I found systemtap is a fantastic tool for exploring the kernel and
userspace applications. While at the very beginning, it seems a little bit
hard for me to understand and start to use this tool.

After some struggling, I managed to run some tests and notice this tool is
really interesting and useful.

To help me memorize those steps and may help others new comers, this
serials is created.

Those steps and cases in this serials are verified on Ubuntu 18.04, if no
specific distro information is given. Besides the installation part, most
cases are distro independent, AFAIK.

Welcome your comments and suggestions.
